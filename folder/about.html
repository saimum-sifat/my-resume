    <p>
      I am a Global Business graduate with a master’s degree from Kyungsung
      University in South Korea, where I built a strong academic foundation in
      business strategy, international trade, and global market analysis while
      achieving solid academic results. My academic journey has been driven by a
      curiosity about how businesses operate across borders and how data,
      technology, and strategy intersect in modern economies. Studying and
      living abroad has strengthened my cross-cultural competence, adaptability,
      and analytical thinking, enabling me to approach complex business
      challenges from both local and global perspectives.

      Alongside my academic background, I am currently learning full stack web
      development, which has allowed me to develop practical skills in building,
      understanding, and analyzing digital systems from end to end. This
      technical training complements my business and research interests by
      enhancing my ability to work with data-driven platforms, digital business
      models, and technology-enabled decision-making. By combining business
      strategy with hands-on technical skills, I aim to bridge the gap between
      conceptual analysis and real-world implementation.

      I am particularly motivated to pursue advanced research and higher studies
      to deepen my expertise, strengthen my methodological and analytical
      capabilities, and contribute original, impactful research in my field. In
      the long term, my goal is to establish myself as a credible researcher and
      academic professional whose work integrates business insight,
      technological understanding, and global relevance to address complex
      economic and organizational challenges.
